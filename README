To Do:
 - Check metadata works (not sure it does)
 - Renaming doesn't work if you supply a full pathname
 - Fix explanations
 - Use SSL or not
	--ssl (default, wins)
	--no-ssl
 - Example usage
 - Readme
 - list the destination queue names (not that sign doesn't work)

Convert to a Gem??

?? What to do with the files
 - Rename them to put the DocID in


Reference this, we don't currently take mime or date https://confluence.amphora-research.com/display/Docs/Direct+submission+via+HTTP

Note in documentation that renames with docid_oldid

Renaming a rename might not work

Check it is quiet and verbose as needed
